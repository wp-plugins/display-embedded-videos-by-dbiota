You can display a gallery of the embedded Youtube videos within your site.

== Description ==
You can display as a gallery or in a widget one, some or all the youtube videos embedded in your site. They can be shown chronologically (last videos posted) or in a daily random basis, which is more interesting and a powerful tool to get your visitors engaged (each day they visit the video list, it will show a different selection of random videos from your site).

It is simple an clean, just works with shortcodes accepting several parameters. The shortcodes can be easily created in the plugin Settings Page with a Shortcode Wizard

Shortcode example:

[display_embedded_videos mode="chronological" vids_to_display="4" vids_per_line="1"]

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= What does this plugin do? =

It allows you to show your embedded youtube videos somewhere in your site (widgets or content) by using shortcodes

= Will it detect and show all videos posted? =

Once you activate the plugin, it will detect automatically all new videos posted. To detect videos posted previous the plugin activation, you have a button in the plugin settings. Once detected, the process won't be needed to run again ever.

= Can I add my own CSS to customize the video titles? =

This plugin will load devbdb.css from your theme\'s directory if it exists.
If it doesn't exists, it will just load the default devbdb.css that comes with Display Embedded Videos by D.Biota.
This will allow you to upgrade Display Embedded Videos by D.Biota without worrying about overwriting your video title styles that you have created.

= How does de daily_random mode work? =

It will show random videos from your site, changing each day. It can make interesting visiting your site daily for your users.

= I have just installed the plugin, I hadn't videos posted before today, and the daily_random mode doesn't show any video, what happens? =

The daily_random mode show videos posted from yesterday to the beginnig time of the site. Hence if you only have videos from today, you won't see anything. Anyway, don't worry, that case tomorrow you will start to see videos in the daily_random mode.


= Can i choose to show videos only by Category, Tag or Forum (bbpress users)? = 

That can be donde with the PRO version.

= Will I have to modifiy the shortcodes if I upgrade to PRO version? =

No, you won't. They are compatible and will work in the same way. The advantage with the PRO version is that you will have more options to show your videos (by category, by tag or by forum)
